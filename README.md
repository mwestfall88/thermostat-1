#README

This simple thermostat displays a readout from a thermistor to an LCD screen. An optical sensor on the board detects if the lights are on or off and determines whether or not to run the LCD screen. If the lights are off, the LCD screen is turned off to save power. A small potentiometer is also installed to adjust the brighness of the screen.
